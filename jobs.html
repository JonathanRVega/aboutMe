    <b class="UNtitles">About my personal projects and freelancing</b>
    <p>A big part of my revenue comes from freelancing projects that envolve video editing and basic programming. My biggest project started in 2016 when I decided to create a Smash
         Bros Highlight Youtube channel<br>called Plasma Smash, the channel grew quickly in popularity and at its peak reached 30k subscribers, I spent hundreds of hours into the
          channel and decided to leave it to pursue a career in Web and App development.</p>
